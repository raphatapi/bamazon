#### This application allows you to purchase the listed products selecting them by their id.

* If you select a product that's not listed, the app will ask you to choose a valid one.

* If you select a product from the list, the app will ask you how many would you like to buy:

    * If the purchased amount is in stock, the app will provide you with you total due.
    * If the purchased amount equals the total in stock, the app will tell you that's all we have and give you the total due.
    * If the purchased amount exceeds the total in stock, the app will ask you to enter a valid amount.

## Have Fun!
